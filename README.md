1] Given an array of integers and an integer k, you need to find the number of unique k-diff pairs in the array. Here a k-diff pair is defined as an integer pair (i, j), where i and j are both numbers in the array and their absolute difference is k.
EG: Input: [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], k = 2
Output: 2

2] A sorted array is rotated at some unknown point, find the minimum element in it.
EG: Input: [5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1

3] Given an array of integers, find if the array contains any duplicates
EG: Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

4] Find a pair with maximum product in array of Integers
EG: Input: [1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 0]
Output: [6,7]
